## 들어가며

이 포스팅은 [이 글](https://sizovs.net/2019/03/17/the-best-books-all-software-developers-must-read/)의 번역본입니다.

책은 여러분의 가장 훌륭한 멘토입니다. 여러분이 매 달 한 권씩, 그러니까 하루에 10 페이지 정도 분량의 프로그래밍 서적을 읽어나가다 보면, 어느덧 개발 분야에 탄탄한 이해도를 가지고 있는 자신을 발견하게 될 것이고, 더 나아가 여타 개발자보다 뛰어난 개발자가 될 것입니다.

세상에는 셀 수 없이 많은 책들이 있지만, 모든 책들이 동일하게 `좋은 책`이라고는 할 수 없습니다. 아래에 제가 꼽은 최고의 책들을 소개합니다. 개정이 되거나 새로운 책이 나올 때마다 업데이트하도록 하겠습니다.
